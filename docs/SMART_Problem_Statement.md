# SMART Problem Statement: Generative AI Misuse in IT Security

## Problem Statement
Generative AI systems introduce new attack surfaces and amplify existing cyber threat vectors in ways that traditional security frameworks do not fully address. This project investigates both vulnerabilities within AI-driven applications (based on the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models v2.0) and the misuse of AI as an offensive tool in modern cybersecurity contexts.

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to systematically analyze all ten categories defined in the **OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (v2.0)**, alongside selected AI-enhanced attack scenarios.

**For each of the ten OWASP vulnerabilities, the project will:**
*   Provide a **technical explanation** of the vulnerability.
*   Present at least **one realistic misuse scenario** illustrating the risk.
*   Analyze **underlying causes** and potential security impacts.
*   Identify a minimum of **two relevant mitigation strategies** or technical countermeasures.

Additionally, the project will examine **selected AI-enhanced attack techniques** (e.g., AI-supported phishing and automated reconnaissance) to assess how generative AI amplifies traditional cyber threats.

## Measurable Objectives
The project will:
*   Produce structured analyses for **all ten OWASP LLM v2.0 vulnerability categories**.
*   Document at least **one misuse scenario per vulnerability** (using practical testing where feasible).
*   **Assess defensive strategies** based on their effectiveness, implementation complexity, and limitation factors.
*   Synthesize findings into a final **"Findings" report** comparing vulnerabilities by impact, exploitability, and mitigation difficulty.

## Timeline
The research will be conducted over a 12-week period (Weeks 6–17) and will result in a structured, web-based knowledge base documenting all technical findings and defensive strategies.
